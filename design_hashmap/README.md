# Solution

[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/)

- Design hashmap without dictionary is how you manipulate hash and array to take O(1) for searching, inserting and deleting

- I tested open address and separate chaining. Separate chaining is better runtime, less memory than open address. I assume the lots of test cases are write-heavy so open address mechanism needs to extend memory frequently
